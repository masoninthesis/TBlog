# [Nudist Theme](http://Jackalope.io/)

Nudist is a bare-naked Wordpress Theme based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for people who think things like Github, Grunt, and PHP are hard. Nudist was created so that designers and people who have never coded before can harness the power of [Roots](http://roots.io/).

To get started, check out [http://jackalope.io/nudist/](http://jackalope.io/nudist/)!

To stay organized, feel free to [follow along on this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/PhHVRdL0/installing-nudist). We've also created [Video Tutorials](http://jackalope.io/) to walk you through step-by-step.
